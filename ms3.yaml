This project will recreate the standar game Pac-Man. The implementation should 
include a playable Pac-Man character that can move around the maze and collect 
pellets, four ghost characters that move independently around the maze and chase
the player, a score system that tracks the number of pellets collected and the 
time taken to complete the game, and an end game condition that triggers 
when the player is caught by a ghost or all the pellets are collected. The 
entire interface will be generated using a terminal library and we will 
incorporate a graphical user interface (GUI) toward the conclusion of the project.

First install all packages needed from CS 3110.

In the terminal, install Graphics module using:
$ opam install graphics

Download the zip file and unzip it to your preferred directory. 

In the terminal, cd to the right directory: CS3110-Final-Project, and then enter:
dune build
make play

Then, you can see the new window and start the game. 

If not working, we could demo it for you during our meeting.
